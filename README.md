# CPE-487-Musical-Brick-Breaker
This is my group's final project for CPE 487 

The goal of our project is to make Musical Brick Breaker by reusing the old pong lab and expanding upon it with music and brick breaker elements. The team look at various resources online and those resources helped are present within this folder.
