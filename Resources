How to make rectangles: http://ece320web.groups.et.byu.net/labs/VGAObjectDisplay/VGA_Object_Display.html

For example, the following two lines of VHDL define a white rectangle that is 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels high. 

rectangle_on <= '1' when pixel_x >= 150 and pixel_x <= 250 and 
                         pixel_y >= 100 and pixel_y <= 150 
                  else '0';
rectangle_rgb <= "111";

Score counter needed 

if(block is hit) {
block dies 
score++; 
}
else{
nothing happens
}
